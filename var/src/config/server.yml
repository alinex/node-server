# Configuration for production server
# =================================================


# Server listening
# -------------------------------------------------

# ### Ports
#
# Set the port the server is listening on.
#
# To use a privileged port below 1024 you have to bind it using root privileges.
# This may be critical.
# The following three methods are possible to do this securely:
#
# 1.  Use sudo to start the server and it will change back to the normal user
#     after port binding.
#
# 2.  Start as root user but use the uid/gid setting below to change after
#     port binding
#
# 3.  Use ip-tables to forward to an unprivileged port:
#     `sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3000`
#
# 4.  Use Nginx reverse-proxy on port 80 this helps also if you may run other
#     things on port 80, too.
#
# Keep in mind to use different ports for different services like HTTP and
# HTTPS. Defaults to port 23174 if not set.
port: 80

# This will configure the server to use SSL. Remove the complete section to
# use normal http.
#ssl:
#  key: server.key
#  cert: server.crt
#  ca: server.crt

# Debugging settings
# -------------------------------------------------
# To enable debugging set this to some possible and free ports.
#debug: false
#  port: 5858
#  inspectorPort: 3009
